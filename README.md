= rget

rget makes it easy to download files by being a very highlevel interface to axel, curl and wget. It doesn't require any of them as it will fall back to a standard ruby download implementation in case it doesn't find any of them. 

There are not special options supported here. You want to do something fancy? Then call the individual binaries directly.
